**Description:**

"Ian Strom" the Booty-bay rogue trainer doesn't look to require any level for training in spell ranks up to level 60.

**Current behaviour:**

See above

**Expected behaviour:**

Ranks should have the usual level requirement as with other trainers.

**Steps to reproduce the problem:**

CHANGEME
Doesn't look triggered by anything at all (Race, level etc.) but is just the passive state of the npc


Be very specific here! Even if the problem seems general, do tell which spells did you use, on what creature, in which conditions. (Very often the problem is only happening in a specific context)

**rev. hash/commit:** 

CHANGEME
Do a `.server info` in game and copy/screenshot the first line.  
For example: `Sunstrider rev. 10455 2019-01-09 11:31:41 +0100 (my branch) (Win64, RelWithDebInfo, Static) (worldserver)`
